# Frank-Game-But-Fixed
This is NOT my project.  This is Delcatty's (sister of DankPods) repository.  I did not help create this game.  I only fixed the speed of the snake, the turn of the snake, and the size of the score and highscore.  Changed the name of "var snake" and "var apple" to "frank" and "rat" accordingly for a little easter egg in the code.  I also made the snake look more like Frank :)  
Delcatty, feel free to request to edit (I'll ask you on Floatplane if it is your username, or you can just say it there, just for safety).  I'll give you full permission since there was tons of stuff I had no clue how to edit properly right above the C# section.  Great job at the base of the game btw, beautifull coding ðŸ‘Œ
